#Project 1: Build a Responsive Website!
Pick a design implemented in Adobe XD from the provided collection of designs.
##Requirements
The goal is to build an accurate clone of your chosen site. Do your best to get everything looking as similar as possible. Treat it like you were handed this mockup and given a deadline to deliver it. Use all the available resources you've been given - documentation, your peers, your instructors, placeholder images, etc.

Additionally, your site should be responsive (meaning it looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop).

Use media queries to rearrange content so that it looks good on different devices. If your mock only has designs for desktop, then it's up to you to figure out how to make it look good on mobile. Great! It's really common in the industry for designers to come up with the desktop designs and then have the developers figure out the best way to present it on mobile and tablet.

Finally, you should deploy your website to GitHub Pages. This is a free hosting service provided by GitHub for deploying static websites (no server or database). This is the part of the project that you get to figure out on your own! smiley

In sum, the requirements for this project are:

* Pick a mock and implement it with HTML and CSS
* Make your mock responsive using media queries
* Deploy your website to GitHub Pages
